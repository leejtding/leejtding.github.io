Hello! I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at
the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, advised by Dr. 
[Rui Wang](https://www.populationmedicine.org/people/researchers/rui-wang). I 
am supported by an NIH NIAID Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award
(NRSA) Individual Predoctoral Fellowship (F31). 

My research focuses on developing flexible study designs and statistical methods for
analyzing complex data arising in infectious disease settings. My recent work includes:
1. Sample size estimation for group sequential cluster randomized trials under
varying design and recruitment scenarios.
2. Unblinded sample size re-estimation and other interim design adaptations in 
cluster randomized trials.
3. A nonparametric deep learning approach for estimating the conditional
survival function with interval-censored data.

Previously, I earned my Sc.B. in Applied Mathematics with Honors from Brown
University. I completed my honors thesis with Dr. [Lorin Crawford](https://www.lorincrawford.com/),
where I developed a multivariate Biologically Annotated Neural Networks (mvBANNs) 
framework for association mapping in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). I 
also worked with Drs. [Bjorn Sandstede](https://bjornsandstede.com/) and 
[Veronica Ciocanel](https://sites.math.duke.edu/~ciocanel/) on estimating 
parameter identifiability for PDE models in cell biology. Additionally, I spent 
two summers as an intern at the NIH NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and 
Genetics, where I worked with Dr. [Philip Rosenberg](https://irp.nih.gov/pi/philip-rosenberg) 
on nonparametric methods for cancer surveillance data.
